# Parameters on SIRD

In this project we use Python to simulate a model of epidemiology, the model that we will use is a simplification of the SIRD model with vaccine. The goal of this notebook is to show how small changes in the parameters may produce big changes in the simulation.

This notebook is to show an example of how mathematics is applied to other fields. It is not a project about epidemiology.
